# Fighters101.V2

This is another approach to creating a fighting game. The actual code is in Idea.html, and this spawned off of me having trouble looping through sectins of the sprite image in Fighters 101.
I took a new approach which was to already define the area of the picture the program should display. Hence the arrays containing objects that have x, y, width and height attributes. This way I have more control over the variety of sprites. However, it was a bit tedious to go through every single image and get the appropriate widths and heights.
Admittedly my initial approach works when looping through sprites with consistent spacing and frame counts, but I don't make my own sprites and finding resources with the same standard online for all their sprites is rather difficult.
So moving forward creating the indivdual sprites and areas for them will be the approach I take, unless I figure out an alternative the current approach.
